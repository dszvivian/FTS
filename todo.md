## RoadMap

- [ ] Loading all the Documents(ie: In a Efficient way)
- [ ] Buid a Time Recording Method to Record the Timing it took to find that word
- [ ] Try Brute Force method(Looping through all the documents and searching for that word)
- [ ] Use Regex to Faster Search
- [ ] Build a Index for quick calculations
    - [ ] Building a Tokenizer(ie: Assignes a value For Each Word)
    - [ ] Adding additional Filters
        - [ ] converting the text to Lowercase
        - [ ] Dropping common words in a sentence(ie: Maybe)
        - [ ] Stemming(ie: Running -> run)
- [ ] Using the Same Tokenizer for the input Query
